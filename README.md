# middle.js
a micro-library for quick implementation of "middleware" support into any project.
By "middleware" I mean something between Express.js middleware pattern and event handling in javascript.

This tool will help you implement [open/closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle) principle from [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))

I have mentioned it is micro library, yes, it is only one constructor with one method. Really!
